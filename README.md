# Meta RL Project

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) world model** using PyTorch. The model learns to simulate environments and predict future states, enabling the creation of intelligent agents that can plan and act efficiently.

## Features

- RL agent with a world model architecture
- State prediction and environment simulation
- Policy optimization for agent actions
- Data visualization tools for model evaluation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomasrowe5/meta-rl-project.git
cd meta-rl-project
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Train the model:
python train.py
Visualize results:
python visualize.py
Run tests:
python test.py
