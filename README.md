# MetaRLAgent Project

MetaRLAgent is a modular reinforcement learning agent framework built in Python. It demonstrates the ability to load pre-trained models, make predictions based on input states, and provides a foundation for further experimentation with automated testing and report generation.

## Features

- **Modular Agent Design**: `MetaRLAgent` is implemented as a Python package (`model/`) for easy extension.
- **Model Loading**: Supports loading pre-trained PyTorch models.
- **Action Prediction**: Provides a `predict` method that takes a state (NumPy array) and returns an action.
- **Configurable Experiments**: Ready to integrate with JSON configuration files for experimentation.

## Project Structure

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MetaRLAgent.git
cd MetaRLAgent
Create and activate a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Import the agent:
from model.model import MetaRLAgent
import numpy as np

agent = MetaRLAgent(model_path="path/to/your/model.pth")
state = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])
action = agent.predict(state)
print(f"Predicted action: {action}")
Currently, MetaRLAgent predicts random actions if no trained model is provided.
Next Steps
This project is designed to evolve into an automated ML model testing pipeline, with:
Looping over test cases
Validating predictions against expected results
Generating reports for performance tracking
These features are planned for future updates.
