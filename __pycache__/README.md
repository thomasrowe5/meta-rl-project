# Meta RL World Model

A reinforcement learning project implementing a **World Model** for simulating environments and training policies. This project explores advanced AI concepts such as model-based RL, environment simulation, and policy optimization.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **World Model Architecture**: Simulates the environment to predict future states, enabling efficient policy learning.
- **Policy Network**: Learns optimal actions based on predicted environment states.
- **Data Visualization**: Tracks performance and training progress with easy-to-understand visual outputs.
- **Extensible**: Designed for experimentation with different network architectures and hyperparameters.
